# Descriptions

* I have no experience with sketch and am not very good at react.js, so I spent nearly 8 hours to complete the work. :D
* Include sass to help managing and organizing style.
* The layout is mainly based on flex-box, which is really kindy and responsive. Just do a litte responsive design. Use :target pseudo-element to show and hide the profile panel.
* Some of the components like ListView, Notice are easy to reuse while others (Nav, Tip) will be more powerful with improvement.
* Sorry I don't write any unit-test or e2e-test code because the time is limited and these components are focus on UI.
